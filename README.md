# "Assignment2"
The entire assignment in Spring Boot. Everything is in the proper folders (model, controllers, etc.) and since it uses the memory database, H2, it can be run locallly without issue

# "INET 2005 - Assignment02.docx"
The original assignment instructions, just nice to have here

# "Output.pdf"
A screenshot of every page of this webapp in a documment, running it is better to see how it works, but these are nice to have.

# "Assignment3Again"
The second version of this assignment with session management and improved code quality

# "INET 2005 - Assignment03.docx"
The original assignment instructions for the second part of this assignment, just nice to have here

# "p2output.png"
An output of the sign in page, it's fairly difficult to show an entire website through just images, so it's better to see it running (make sure to have xxamp and have Apache and MySQL running)
