# "Assignment2"
The entire assignment in Spring Boot. Everything is in the proper folders (model, controllers, etc.) and since it uses the memory database, H2, it can be run locallly without issue

# "INET 2005 - Assignment02.docx"
The original assignment instructions, just nice to have here

# "Output.pdf"
A screenshot of every page of this webapp in a documment, running it is better to see how it works, but these are nice to have.
